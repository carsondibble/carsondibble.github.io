        <h3>Although Ross’ perm is one of his most recognizable characteristics, he did not actually like the hairdo.
            His hair had usually been straight, but he tried a perm so he could let his hair grow longer and save money
            on fewer haircuts. When the perm became integrated into the company logo, he was unable to change it, much
            to his frustration.</h3>
