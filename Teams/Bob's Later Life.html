    >Bob Ross discovered oil painting while he was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in the early 1960s. </h3>
    He studied the “wet-on-wet” technique, which allowed him to produce complete paintings in less than an hour.</h3>
    After becoming an instructor himself, Ross launched the PBS television series The Joy of Painting, where he taught his technique to millions of viewers.
    Ross became beloved for his light humor, gentle demeanor, and distinctive look and hairstyle.
    Following his death in 1995 from lymphoma, Ross has remained a household name and generated a new following on digital media platforms like YouTube and Twitch.''
