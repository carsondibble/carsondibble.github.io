    <h3>Bob Ross discovered oil painting while he was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in the early 1960s. </h3>
    <h3>He studied the “wet-on-wet” technique, which allowed him to produce complete paintings in less than an hour.</h3>
    <h3>After becoming an instructor himself, Ross launched the PBS television series The Joy of Painting, where he taught his technique to millions of viewers.</h3>
    <h3> Ross became beloved for his light humor, gentle demeanor, and distinctive look and hairstyle.</h3>
    <h3>Following his death in 1995 from lymphoma, Ross has remained a household name and generated a new following on digital media platforms like YouTube and Twitch.''</h3>
