        Bob Ross discovered oil painting while he was enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in the early 1960s.
        He studied the “wet-on-wet” technique, which allowed him to produce complete paintings in less than an hour.
        After becoming an instructor himself, Ross launched the PBS television series The Joy of Painting, where he
        taught his technique to millions of viewers.
        Ross became beloved for his light humor, gentle demeanor, and distinctive look and hairstyle.
        Following his death in 1995 from lymphoma, Ross has remained a household name and generated a new following on
        digital media platforms like YouTube and Twitch.

        Bob was passionate about sharing his love for painting with the world and in 1982 along with his partners he
        launched the Joy of Painting on public television.
        To promote the television show and reach a greater audience Bob toured America teaching others to paint.
        In the beginning, the classes that were offered in shopping malls and art stores yielded only small groups of
        students.
        As word of the popular TV show grew so did the live audiences for his public lessons. From 1982 through 1994,
        Bob recorded more than 400 episodes and the The Joy of Painting.
        The show remains today, one of the most popular and well known shows on public television.
        Bob’s passion for teaching and inspiring others lives on today through the thousands of instructors who teach
        his method around the world.
